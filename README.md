# Graph-Plotter
The _"graph-plotter.py"_ file helps to plot diverse graphs based on your input values. Currently, the program is supported only on [Unix-based Operating Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like).<br/>
The scirpt is being developed to make easier the process of creation of graphs for people, who do not how data visualization is done or programming at all.<br/>
The program is under development. Contributions are highly appreciated.

1. Unix-based OS (e.g. Linux, MacOS).
2. pyhton3 or higher.
3. [```matplotlib```](matplotlib.org) python library.

## Instruction
1. Copy the repository to your local machine: ```git clone https://github.com/AAgzamov/Graph-Plotter.git```.
2. If you do not have Python installed, do it [here](python.org).
3. Install required libraries: ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```.
4. If _"fuctions.py"_ and _"graph-plotter.py"_ are not executable, run: ```chmod +x functions.py graph-plotter.py```.
5. Run _"graph-plotter.py"_: ```python3 graph-plotter.py```.
